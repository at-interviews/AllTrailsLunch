## Important Note Regarding API Keys

For the purposes of this job interview assignment, I have included a file (`Secrets.swift`) in the repository that contains a Google Places API key. This key was provided specifically for use in this assignment.

### Security Considerations

In a real-world scenario, I would never include such sensitive information in a public or shared repository. API keys and other credentials should be kept secure and not exposed in version control. Typically, I would:

- Store API keys in environment variables.
- Use encrypted secrets management tools (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).
- Ensure that sensitive files are added to `.gitignore` to prevent them from being checked into version control.

However, I am making an exception here as per the assignment instructions, and I fully understand and adhere to secure coding practices in professional environments.

### Handling of Secrets in Production

In a large organization, protecting intellectual property and sensitive information is a top priority. I am well-versed in the techniques and tools used to ensure that API keys and other secrets are not exposed, and I would implement those best practices in any production environment.

Please review the code with this context in mind.
